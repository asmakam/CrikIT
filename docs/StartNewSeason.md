##How to start a new season with CrikIT.io?

This guide covers the following use case:
"You've scored the last year with the crikit.io and want to get quickly started on the new season using the existing teams and clubs."

###Step 1: Create a new Tournament [League Admin]

The first step is to create a new tournament for the season. Use the Admin -> Tournament panel to create the tournament.

* Create the correct number of divisions and groups as required.  
*  **[Important]** Set the season to the correct year. If its a new season change the season.
*  Mark the tournament as isActive to enable clubs to see them.

###Step 2: Change the Site Defaults [League Admin]

Its now important to change the **Current Season** and **Default Tournament** to the new one created from the Admin -> Site Config panel as shown below.

*Note: When this change is made, the Tournament widgets on the index page will change to point to this new tournament*

At this point, your new tournament is ready for Clubs to submit their teams.

###Step 3: Editing Rosters and submitting teams [ Club/League Admin]

This step is typically carried out by the individual clubs as they best know the roster. However, the League Admin can quickly go and submit the existing teams in to tournament to get quickly started.

**Submitting Existing Teams:**
1. Go to individual Club Admin page.

4. Now  go back to the Club Admin -> Teams Page and add the new members to the respective teams. Click save. **Ensure that you have a captain selected.**
5. Now go to Club Admin -> Play Tournaments page. This page will now be blank if this is a new season.  Click on Submit a Team and you should be able to submit your teams to the new tournament.

**Submitting New Teams**
The process is the same, apart from the fact that you will create a new Team from Club Admins -> Teams page.

The above steps need to be followed for all clubs to submit their rosters.

###Step 4: Managing/Approving Rosters [League Admin]

This step is only for the league admins to manage the tournament. Go to Admin -> Tournament page and then click on Manage Tournament next to the new tournament.
At this point you will see that teams are Waiting for Approval.

* Clicking on Waiting For Approval, will show you the team roster along with information about the team, the player played last year.
* With Edit, you can change the divisions of the team (if a team mistakenly submits its team to the wrong division)
* With Assign Groups, you can assign the groups if your tournament has groups within the divisions.

####Step 5: Verifying the Rosters after Approval [Clubs Admins/ Team Captains]

This is an encouraged verification step for each club admin, team captain. Once the League Admin approves your team, you will get an email stating that your team has been approved. At this point, you should verify your roster with the approved roster to ensure all your players are present.

You can do this by going to : Clubs -> Tournament Teams (from the home page). Click on your individual team and you should see the approved roster.

![Teams](https://www.dropbox.com/s/biua2f3qud9jhuu/Teams.png?raw=1)

**Only players visible here are available for scoring on the app and on the scorecards**

**Some players are missing, What should I do?**
Go to your Club->Admin Panel. Check if the players are added in Club->Admin->Teams. If the players are added there, then confirm that you have sent the updated roster to to the League Admin to approve. You can do this by going to Club->Admin->Play Tournament and clicking on the Update button

###Step 6: Upload the Schedule [League Admin]

Now the League Admin has the option of uploading the schedule using Excel Template.

1. Go to Admin -> Matches -> Upload Schedule and click on Download to download the template.
2. The Template is pretty self explanatory. Ensure that the team names match against those shown in the Club->Tournament Teams page.
3. Upload the schedule. On Upload we verify that the data is correct. All errors are listed. You can click on any of the matches listed to get more information about the error.

Now, you should be ready to score all the games.
