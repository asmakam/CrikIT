#Introducing CrikIT Docs

##What is CrikIT?

[CrikIT](http://crikit.io), is an online league management and administration platform designed to take the pain out of the day-to-day tasks related to managing a cricket league, tournament, club, or an organization.

CrikIT's features include:
*A fully customizable website for the league as well as each of its registered club
*Live scoring and ball-by-ball updates for each game
*Ability to generate ad revenue from the league website
*Ability to edit uploaded scorecards in entirety or update previously saved drafts
*Auto updating standings, statistics, and NRR
*A league specific mobile app to follow or score live games and to access statistics, news, and polls
*Social media integration including tweets, Facebook page feed and YouTube video feed
*Ability to publish news, polls, images, and featured news directly from admin panel
*Separate user privileges including league admin, club admin, club member, and umpire

CrikIT platform has two components:
1. League specific website
2. League specific iOS and Android app

Once you are onboard the CrikIT platform, we would work closely with you to have your website and mobile apps ready. We would also grant you (and your fellow admins) the admin access to the website. Your league website can be completely customized to your taste using the admin access.

##What do I do next?
1. If you already have the admin access to your league website, read more about options available in [Admin Panel](/docs/adminpanel.html) to customize your website.
2. If you would like to try out a demo/trial version of CrikIT platform - reach out to us at team@asmakam.com.
